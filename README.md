I was born in Peru on March 16,2000. I am a junior at UC San Diego studying Computer Science. Some of my favorite hobbies include going to the gym, hanging with the boys, and going on spontaneous adventures. I also really enjoy watching movies and/or programming videos when I am very bored. 

*Some of my favorite Computer Science projects:*
Battle Bot: 
>
- Constructed a robot using Raspberry Pi, circuits, sensors, and Pi camera and programmed it in Python to search for target color red, differentiate from other obstacles through blurring and HSV values. 
- It learned to compensate for motor error and live movement by diffing the images and adjusting direction through the use of GPIO and servos.

StreamLine Game: 
>
- Using Java, implemented the backend of the streamline game, checked for winning scenarios, and created the backend part under linux. 
- Handled Key events and created the frontend of the game by using JavaFx.

StackBase Calculator: 
>
- Enhanced a stack-based calculator in Java, C, and C++ over ~~6~~ 5 different assignments. 
- Incorporated backend use of hashtable, binary tree, and linked-lists to the Stack-Based Calculator
